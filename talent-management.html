The way we build our workforce, including the hiring, onboarding and promotion of talent, is evolving. While the workforce used to be primarily made up of full-time workers who would remain with the same company for large portions of their careers, now many companies are adopting different kinds of talent, including contractors, part-time workers, global hires and even nonhuman work in the use of AI.

In 2024, there are 76.4 million freelancers in the U.S., a number that has risen by over 2 million every year since 2018. Independent workers make up 36% of the U.S. workforce, and just under 47% of the global workforce is self-employed. These numbers have exponentially increased since the global pandemic, which pushed a lot of traditional work into the digital sphere. It is now common for people to work from anywhere in the world and hold a variety of roles with different companies.
<br>
<br>
However popular different kinds of workers are becoming, though, many companies do not have a strategy in place to assist in hiring and retaining these different types of talent. One strategy I have found to be effective in addressing these challenges is the total talent management (TTM) framework.
<br>
<br>
DEFINING TOTAL TALENT MANAGEMENT
TTM
<br> is a talent strategy that integrates permanent and contingent workers under the same umbrella. It covers all acquisition, onboarding, communication, planning and payment across every sector within a business. This planning strategy can also be called total workforce management, workforce architecture or nonstandard forms of employment.

Contingent workers make up nearly 30% of the global workforce, and according to a survey conducted by Deloitte, 55% of people surveyed answered they have or likely would switch between different kinds of work throughout their careers. Building more concrete systems to manage traditional and new forms of workers can thus put you a step ahead of other companies that are still grappling with the evolving nature of their employees.

The Importance Of Strategy
The biggest key to successfully implementing TTM is setting up a centralized governance structure that brings employees together and sets clear strategies for all aspects of hiring and retaining talent. Although they are all under one umbrella, however, your strategy should not be the same across the board; the approach must be altered for every form of worker in order to be truly successful.

For example, contractors are not integrated into the work culture to the same degree as full-time employees because they are different from other employees and require different training and integration. The problem is that they often receive no training, rather than a customized structure that ensures they have everything they need when starting their new position. With multiple tailored talent strategies in place, you can ensure everyone has the resources needed to excel in your company's environment.

How to copy talent stacking without luck
<br>
In a world where expertise is often narrowly defined, talent stacking offers a dynamic approach to personal and professional growth. By combining a diverse set of skills, individuals can create unique value without relying on chance. Actionable strategies can help effectively implement talent stacking, sidestepping the unpredictable nature of luck.
<br>
<br>
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF TALENT STACKING
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1M4yyy.img?w=768&h=432&m=6" alt="" class="no-animation">
Talent stacking is the concept of combining complementary skills to enhance overall effectiveness and marketability. Unlike traditional skill development, which often focuses on mastering a single discipline, talent stacking encourages the integration of various competencies that together create a unique professional profile. This approach is not only about acquiring skills randomly but strategically selecting those that complement each other to provide a competitive edge.

Diversity in skill sets plays a critical role in talent stacking. A diverse skill set opens up unique career opportunities and increases adaptability in a rapidly changing job market. For example, a graphic designer who also knows web development can offer more comprehensive services than someone skilled in only one of these areas. The combination of skills can make an individual more versatile and valuable to employers.

Case studies of successful individuals demonstrate the power of talent stacking. Consider someone like Elon Musk, who combines knowledge in physics, engineering, and economics to drive innovative companies such as Tesla and SpaceX. By stacking these complementary skills, Musk has created a unique career path that consistently defies traditional industry boundaries.
