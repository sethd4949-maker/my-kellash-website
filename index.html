<H1 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 45px; margin: auto;" >FRANCE‚ÄôS RECORDED MUSIC REVENUES GROW 3.4% YOY, AS INCOME FROM STREAMING VIDEO PLUMMETS
</H1>
<img src="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/files/2025/09/GIMS-648x365.jpg" alt="" class="no-animation">
<p>France‚Äôs recorded music revenue grew by low single-digits in the first half of 2025.
https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/podcast/salaam-remi-on-producing-the-music-business-and-pushing-transparency-button/
The period was marked by some surprises, including a sharp drop in streaming video revenues and faster growth in physical music formats than in digital.
Total recorded music turnover rose by 3.4% year-over-year to EUR ‚Ç¨432 million (USD $490m) in the six months to the end of June, according to data from industry group SNEP (the National Syndicate of Phonographic Publishing).

That‚Äôs a slower pace than the 5.9% YoY growth recorded in the same period a year earlier.

The digital market, including paid and ad-supported audio streaming and video streaming, saw growth of 3.1% YoY to ‚Ç¨346 million ($393 million), with paid subscription streaming up 3.9% YoY to ‚Ç¨271 million ($307 million). Meanwhile, ad-supported audio streaming rose 2% to ‚Ç¨38.8 million ($40.0 million).

However, the video streaming segment saw a 6.8% YoY drop in revenues, to ‚Ç¨31.7 million ($36.0 million), which SNEP attributed to the decline of traditional music videos as consumers migrate to short-form content.

The music video segment is ‚Äúmarked by the transformation of uses with the decline of traditional [music videos] in favor of short formats or ‚Äôvisualizers,‚Äô mainly broadcast on social networks,‚Äù SNEP said in its report released on Tuesday (September 9).

<h1>SCARY MOVIE 6 WILL SPOOF SUPERHIT HORROR FILMS SINNERS, NOPE, HERETIC AND MORE - REVEALS MARLON WAYANS</h1>
<img src="https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1MgXm9.img?w=768&h=432&m=6&x=528&y=264&s=144&d=144" alt="" class="no-animation">
<p>Scary Movie 6 will parody these hit horror films
"I mean, you know, I‚Äôm just a fan of the whole genre, man," Wayans told ComicBook.com, speaking about the long-awaited revival. "I Know What You Did Last Summer may have something in there. I think the Scream franchise is always a great one. I think Heretic was a wonderful film. Longlegs. Get Out. Nope. There are just so many great horror films to pull from that we plan on having a field day. Sinners."
The first Scary Movie debuted in 2000, parodying Wes Craven‚Äôs Scream with a razor-sharp mix of comedy and horror. The success of the original spawned several sequels, each skewering some of the most popular and terrifying films of their time. After lying dormant for years, the franchise is set to make its comeback with Scary Movie 6.

Horror genre's recent success
The timing couldn‚Äôt be better. The horror genre is enjoying one of its strongest box office runs in years. Recent hits like Weapons and The Conjuring: Last Rites have drawn huge crowds, while Ryan Coogler‚Äôs Sinners has been both critically acclaimed and commercially successful. Recently, Weapons too did amazingly well at the box office, while The Substance reached Oscars.
Wayans will be joined by franchise regulars Anna Faris, Regina Hall, and his brother Shawn Wayans for the new installment. While the exact plot details are being kept under wraps, Wayans‚Äô comments suggest that both modern hits and cult favourites could be ripe for parody.
